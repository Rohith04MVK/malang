# Malang Compiler  
**"They were teaching me compiler design, so a compiler is what I designed."**  

## Malang: A Compiler Born Out of Stubbornness  
Malang is... well, let’s just say it’s a *unique* programming language. Born out of sheer defiance and an unwavering commitment to proving a point, Malang is my way of showing that I *did* in fact pay attention in my compiler design course—whether my professor appreciates the outcome or not.  

Will Malang change the world? No.  
Will it revolutionize software development? Absolutely not.  
Did it make me question my life choices? Almost certainly.  

It’s not just a language. It’s a *concept*. A statement. A joke that spiraled completely out of control. But hey, **I** made a compiler!  

## Features  
- **Manglish to Go Compilation** – Because writing Malayalam in English letters is an art.  
- **Code Generation** – Magic! and go for the most part. 
- **Execution** – You write Manglish, Malang does the rest. Theoretically.  
- **Serious Yet Not Serious** – It works, but should it? Debatable.  \

## Installation
Since you clearly have excellent taste, getting started is easy:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rohith04MVK/malang
cd malang
go build -o malang
```
## Examples
*coming soon*


## Why Malang?
Because learning is best when it’s fun, and nothing says *"I understand compiler design"* quite like creating a language nobody needed.

## Contributing
If you understand this project on a deep level, I have two things to say:
1. I'm impressed.
2. I'm impressed.

But hey, PRs are welcome.

## License
MIT—because even legally, I refuse to take this too seriously. You’re free to use, modify, and distribute Malang, but if you actually deploy it in production, that’s on you.
